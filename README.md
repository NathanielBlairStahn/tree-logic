# Tree Logic

## Image classification technology for tree species identification.

The model uses transfer learning to identify three species of trees commonly found in Seattle. Image features are extracted using Google's Inception V3 convolutional neural network and then fed into a custom fit Gradient Booster for classification.  The classifier achieves an accuracy of 77% on three classes after being trained on a data set of 1639 images, significantly improving on the baseline random-choice accuracy of 33%.
